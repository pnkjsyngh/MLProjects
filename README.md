# Machine Learning Projects

<h3> 1. <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/pnkjsyngh/MLProjects/blob/main/EDA/Project1.ipynb"><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong></a></h3>

This project involves conducting an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on [Cardio Good Fitness data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/cardiogoodfitness), which contains information on customers of treadmill products, including their age, gender, education, marital status, usage, fitness, income, and expected miles to run. The objective of the project is to identify differences between customers of each product, explore relationships between customer attributes, and propose additional relevant questions for the business. The project will deliver a customer profile for each product, perform univariate and multivariate analyses, and generate insights and recommendations for the company to target new customers. 

#### Skills gained
- **Descriptive Statistics**, **Inferential Statistics** and **Probability Distributions**
- Demonstrated effective use of **NumPy**, **Pandas** and **Seaborn** libraries to generate custom visualizations which captures the essence of the dataset and delivers the key message.

<h3> 2. <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/pnkjsyngh/MLProjects/blob/main/LinearRegression/Project2.ipynb"><strong>Linear Regression</strong></a></h3>

The project involves developing a pricing model for used cars in the Indian market to help a tech start-up called Cars4U, which aims to find footholds in this market. The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmanibedi/cars4u) contains different attributes of used cars sold in various locations, including brand and model name, location, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, ownership type, engine displacement, power, mileage, seats, new car price, and used car price. The project objective is to **explore and visualize the dataset**, build a **linear regression model** to predict the prices of used cars, and generate insights and recommendations to help the business. The project deliverables include a pricing model, linear regression predictions, and actionable insights and recommendations.

<h3> 3. <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/pnkjsyngh/MLProjects/blob/main/LogisticRegression/Project3.ipynb"><strong>Logistic Regression</strong></a></h3>

The goal of this project is to help AllLife Bank increase their loan business by building a model to identify potential customers who are likely to purchase a personal loan. The data contains customer attributes such as age, income, education level, and whether or not they accepted a personal loan in the past. The deliverables include predicting whether a liability customer will buy a personal loan, determining which variables are most significant, and identifying which customer segment should be targeted more.

#### Skills gained
- *Confusion matrix*, *perfromace metrics*
- *Decision Tree*, *Pruning*, *model performance and feature selection*
- *Logistic regression*, *ROC-AUC curve*, *Precision-Recall curve* 
- Delivered the models based on Logistic regression and Decision Tree, with metrics shown below.

| Metrics       | Logistic Regression | Decision Tree |
|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
| Accuracy      | 0.925333	          | 0.938000      |
