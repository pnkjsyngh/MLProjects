<h3> 1. <a href="https://nbviewer.org/github/pnkjsyngh/MLProjects/blob/main/EDA/Project1.ipynb"><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong></a></h3>

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on [Cardio Good Fitness data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurav9786/cardiogoodfitness), which contains information on customers of treadmill products, including their age, gender, education, marital status, usage, fitness, income, and expected miles to run. The objective of the project is to identify differences between customers of each product, explore relationships between customer attributes, and propose additional relevant questions for the business. The project will deliver a customer profile for each product, perform univariate and multivariate analyses, and generate insights and recommendations for the company to target new customers. Following were the key findings from this analysis,
- The dataset includes information about 180 treadmill sales and customer demographics.
- Three models of treadmills were sold: TM195, TM498, and TM798, with different customer profiles.
- TM195 and TM498 are suitable for entry/intermediate level fitness equipment and can be marketed to a broader demographic, while TM798 is an advanced level fitness equipment targeting customers with high fitness levels and higher income.
- There is an untapped market for advanced female users in TM798, and women-centered promotion for all three models can benefit sales.

Skills gained
- Covers Descriptive Statistics, Inferential Statistics and Probability Distributions
- Demonstrates effectiive use of NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn libraries to generate custom visualizations which captures the essence of the dataset and easily delivers the key message.
